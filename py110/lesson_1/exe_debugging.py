2 - Reverse a String
You have a function that is supposed to reverse a string passed as an argument. However, it's not producing the expected 
output. Explain the bug, and provide a solution.

        string = char + string

# Strings are immutable, so that line creates a new string each time by putting the current character in front of the
# current value of string. Because the loopâ€™s iterator was built from the original value, the original characters still
